I'm a PhD (engineering) candidate in the `Department of Applied Mechanics`_ at
the `Indian Institute of Technology Madras`_ (IITM). I work in `The Uncertainty
Lab`_ and the `Biomimetics and Dynamics Lab`_ under the guidance of `Dr. Sayan
Gupta`_ and `Dr. Sunetra Sarkar`_.

Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's in technology (B.Tech) from the
`Department of Ocean Engineering`_, IITM and master's in technology (M.Tech)
from the `Department of Applied Mechanics`_, IITM.

My research involves computational modelling and model order reduction of
acousto-elastic interactions in high-pressure centrifugal compressor-like
geometries. Computational models are developed using the Finite Element Method
(FEM) for visco-thermal and classical acousto-elastic interactions, and the
order of these models are reduced using Krylov subspace-based methods for
greater computational efficiency.

I'm also interested in probabilistic mechanics, uncertainty quantification,
fluid-structure interactions, and general computational modelling.

of my work, and other projects on which I work during my time off, can be found
